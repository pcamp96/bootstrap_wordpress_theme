# Carbon-ROM.com Website 
## By PatrickC

### Why we're doing this
Because we are all about open source stuff, this is the template that we will use for the front-end of the CarbonROM website

### How can I see the progress?!?!?!
We will have development versions of the site that we put live later on, for now, there is none. Sorry. You can visit our current site at http://carbon-rom.com

### Resources Used
None yet! Still a bare repository for now ;)

##License
We are still deciding on the license, but for now, it's GPL
